* Please remove the categories button in the top right header. 
* The category button in the grid-toolbar should open the categories popup instead of toggling. It should also not show the name of the theme, but just say categories
* The varies items in the category list does not have an on hover effect.
* It is not possible to select other notes than the active one in mobile view
* The search functionality should show with the results shown in a seperate window. It should not use the current lists of items.
* The scrollbar in the dark modes (dark, futuristic) does not really follow the theme, if possible in a reasonable manner, please make it follow the theme.

Currently to add a new app it needs to be added several places - is there a neat way to make sure it should only be added in one place? - Dont implement, just answer here.
